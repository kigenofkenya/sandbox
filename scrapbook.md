## Describing the domain.
 
Essentially the task is to catalog the different experiments and implementations and piece together how they can be useful or at least those parts of those projects that can be used elsewhere.

### DataOut

Data and file formats.

* json
* yaml
* csv



Needs, get/set/transform/display and share data.

It's also essential to describe and document the tools and situations that have become a regular part of my work-flow.
For example, js libs like:

* nedbJS
* ractiveJS
* sugarJS

--these are as much as possible node and browser compatible.


Parsing / Namespace management / Validation

* xtend
* schema validate
* SugarJS


painless restful sync.

and konkurrently... pending and owerdue best prakties like styleguides, standad stoage lokations.. projekt boilerplates.. referenes like  heatsheets and quik guides for kommonnly used tools.


mixins like using yaml front matter and being able to bundle funtions in a ymf file.

konweniense tools like spelunk - being able to katalogue all the files in a direktory

pending and owerdue enhansements to workflow like nodedew konsole, template/data systems... like just-template-it.

###Vendor App enhancements and mixins.

1. Sublime Text enhancement descriptions.
2. Description of Dashdocs features and usage.
3. A Mixin, sublime and dashdocs.
description of enhancements to vendor apps like sublimetext.
expanding horizons like telegram as a tool to link communication/machine learning etc.


Purpose

independent client that can sync when needed, server that handles time saving tools.


Essentially the task is to atalogue the diffeent eperiments and implementations and piee togethe how they an be ueful o at least hat parts of those pojet ans be ueyfl.

its also useufl to find myself in situations where tools hae beome part of the egular workflow.

Explanation why certain tools are preferred. For example sugar over lodash and underscore.

mixins like using yaml front matter and being able to bundle funtions in a ymf file.
